            <h3 class="page-title"> Mission Statement </h3>

            <p> To provide opportunities for students expand their knowledge of international issues through Model United Nations. </p>

            <h3 class="page-title"> Manifesto </h3>

            <p> Model United Nations provides students with a unique opportunity to experience international politics hands on while learning valuable speech, debate, writing and interpersonal skills. The Portland Waldorf High School Model United Nations Club (PWHSMUNC) looks to provide PWHS students with the option to experience these opportunities. </p>

            <p> These opportunities are provided by holding meetings led by students for students discussing current issues, as well as learning speech, debate, and writing skills. The culmination of the club is attending Model United Nation conferences each year. </p>

            <p> Started by Jackson Manwaring-Perks in 2017, PWHSMUNC has continued to grow ever since. </p>
